Overview

Dunder Mifflin is a mid-size paper supply company headquartered in New York, NY, with thirteen regional branches spread across the North-Eastern US and 300 employees. The company serves a total of about 5,000 clients at any given time. It is a publicly traded company that brings in an average of $48 million in revenue each year, with a profit margin of 3%. Facing competition from large national chains like Staples and Office Depot, Dunder Mifflin needs a functional and responsive database management system in order to streamline processes. This system will be used to manage each Branchâ€™s Employees, Departments, Customers, Products, and Invoices, and will allow for efficient data entry by employees. Dunder Mifflin hopes this system will increase profit margins by allowing employees to spend more time building customer relationships, and less time on data entry.
